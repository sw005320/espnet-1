"""Metrics that need the whole corpus at once.

BLEU is the reason this tier exists: corpus BLEU is not the average of
sentence BLEUs, so it cannot be computed one utterance at a time and then
summarized. VERSA draws the same line, in ``versa/corpus_metrics``.

The contract mirrors VERSA's corpus tier::

    def bleu_setup(**kwargs) -> Any:
        '''Build whatever scoring this metric needs.'''

    def bleu_scoring(scorer, pred_texts, gt_texts) -> dict:
        '''Return a flat dict of corpus-level result keys.'''

``pred_texts`` and ``gt_texts`` are lists in the same utterance order;
:func:`splet.scorer_shared.corpus_scoring` does the matching by key.

BLEU, chrF and TER call sacrebleu rather than reimplement it, and record the
signature sacrebleu reports -- the signature is what makes the number
comparable with a published one, and a BLEU without it is not reproducible.
See :mod:`splet.corpus_metrics.bleu` and the discussion in espnet/espnet#6735.
